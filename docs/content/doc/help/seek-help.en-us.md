**NOTE:** When asking for support, please always provide the following data, so that the person helping has all the info they need. This increases your chances of getting help significantly.

1. The `gitea.log` (and any other appropriate log files for the situation)
    * Learn [here]({{< relref "doc/advanced/logging-documentation.en-us.md" >}}#debugging-problems) how to enable debug logging to get the most useful logs.
    * e.g. If the error is related to the database, the `xorm.log` might be helpful.
2. Your `app.ini` (with any sensitive data scrubbed as necessary)
3. Any error messages you are seeing
4. When possible, try to replicate the issue on [try.gitea.io](https://try.gitea.io) and include steps so that others can reproduce the issue.
    * This will greatly improve the chance that the root of the issue can be quickly discovered and resolved.
